		<h2>How to play:</h2>
		<p>
			You have to make a valid word that starts with the letter S. The longer the word, the more
			points you'll get. So, we start with the letter S, and the next letter is randomly generated.
			You can choose to keep it, or go one letter back, or go one letter forward.
		</p>
		<i
			>Example: start with S, lets say the second letter will be F ( it was randomly generated).
			Now, there isn't a word that starts with SF. So in this case we'll go one letter back to E.</i
		>
		<p>
			We continue this process letter by letter until we can either make a valid word, or we resign
			our turn.
		</p>
		<p>Now, the interesting part is that we have 3 powerups we can use in the game.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Any Letter</li>
			<p>Choose any letter for the current letter.</p>
			<li>Reroll</li>
			<p>Reroll current letter.</p>
			<li>Clone Letter</li>
			<p>Make a copy of another letter you have active.</p>
		</ol>
		<p>
			How you decide to use these powerups is your choice, and there is no right way to play. So get
			creative with your strategies, and have fun making as make words as you can.
